=== Introduction

This egg provides a client library for the featherweight hypertext
transfer protocol, [[https://gemini.circumlunar.space/|Gemini]].

Features:

* Interprets {{gemini://}} URLs using the {{uri-generic}} egg.
* Handles Gemini's compulsory TLS encryption using the {{openssl}} egg.
* Parses the response header into a Scheme record.
* Provides a condition type for unsuccessful Gemini responses.

Gemini's standard markup language, Gemtext, is not parsed by this egg.

=== Make a request

<procedure>(gemini-get uri handle-response)</procedure>

Make a TLS-encrypted connection to the Gemini server at the host and
port of {{uri}} (the default port is 1965). Ask for {{uri}} and call
the procedure {{handle-response}} with the response object as an
argument.

{{uri}} must be a {{gemini://}} URI. It can be either a string or a
URI object from the {{uri-generic}} egg.

=== Response object

<procedure>(gemini-response? object)</procedure>

Return {{#t}} if {{object}} is a Gemini response object, {{#f}}
otherwise.

<procedure>(gemini-response-code response)</procedure>

Return the two-digit code at the very beginning of a Gemini response
as a integer.

<procedure>(gemini-response-first-digit response)</procedure>
<procedure>(gemini-response-second-digit response)</procedure>

Return either digit of the code as an integer. The first digit
indicates the response category, the second is a detail.

<procedure>(gemini-response-success? response)</procedure>

Return {{#t}} if this is a success response (code 2x), {{#f}}
otherwise.

<procedure>(gemini-response-redirect? response)</procedure>

Return {{#t}} if this is a redirect response (code 3x), {{#f}}
otherwise.

<procedure>(gemini-response-meta response)</procedure>

Return the "meta" text: the remainder of the first line of the
response after the status code.

<procedure>(gemini-response-port response)</procedure>

Return a binary input port from which the response body can be read.
The caller should not close the port.

<procedure>(gemini-response-read-bytevector-all response)</procedure>
<procedure>(gemini-response-read-string-all response)</procedure>

Convenience procedures to read the entire response body and return it
as as bytevector or a string, respectively.

<procedure>(gemini-response-raise response)</procedure>

Convenience procedure which raises an appropriate exception unless
{{response}} is a success ({{2x}}) response. The exception raised
satisfies {{gemini-error?}}, and calling {{gemini-error-response}} on
it returns {{response}}. If {{response}} is a success response,
{{gemini-response-raise}} returns {{#f}}.

=== Error object

<procedure>(gemini-error? object)</procedure>

Return {{#t}} if {{object}} is a Gemini error condition, {{#f}}
otherwise.

<procedure>(gemini-error-response gemini-error)</procedure>

Return the Gemini response object (satisfies {{gemini-response?}})
associated with the error, of {{#f}} if none.

=== Example

  (display (gemini-get
            "gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom/"
            (lambda (response)
              (or (gemini-response-raise response)
                  (gemini-response-read-string-all response)))))
